# Encoder-Decoder
Program to encode and decode the text

Suppose you want to chat with your friend in codelanguage.
So for that I've made the program in which you can easily do that.
Scripts are in python
Save both the scripts on your pc, encode.py and decode.py

To send the encoded text, run encode.py and put your text there.
This script will copy your text automatically to the clipboard for 5 secs(this time interval you can change if you want) 

To decode the received text, just copy the received text and run decode.py and you'll get your decoded text on your screen.
